This is a PHP sandbox for playing with RSS feeds.

A few areas I'm playing around with are:
 - Extracting data from RSS easily
 - Rendering content dynamically, using jQuery

A few items to note
 - This example fulfills the tasks of
 -- using up-to-date HTML structures (divs, external CSS, external JS, etc)
 -- using AJAX to grab the RSS feed from a PHP proxy
 -- The feed source is set to the New York Times' Home Page RSS Feed
 -- The PHP Feed Processor removes any ads (at least those using the expected format) from the description nodes of the feed
